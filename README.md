## Land Acknowledgment
We begin by acknowledging with respect the Onondaga Nation, Central Fire of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, on whose ancestral lands we now inhabit. Wherever you are located be aware of the Indigenous Peoples on whose lands you reside. We are mindful that the technology that makes this conference possible comes from the mineral extraction by multinational corporations, which decimate and displace Indigenous people and their land all over the world. May the information you glean from this website motivate you to uphold Indigenous values, protect Mother Earth, Honor Indian Treaties and hold your government and various institutions accountable who stand in the way.

## Preface
I have become frustrated with how slow and limited in accessibility WordPress is so I decided to start moving sites I administer over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because as static site generator it is faster, more reliable and I have more control over making it accessible.

## Getting Started
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/blob/master/LICENSE)

I decided to go with @mmistakes theme [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) because in [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

### Minimal Mistakes
Minimal Mistakes is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as
a substitute for the default [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), with a
few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with six customizable skins
- About page layout
- Site-wide search provided by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/).

### Prerequisites

- Flat file
- static site
- no filler
- SSL
- Github Pages

## Built With
* [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
* [System Font Stack](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/)



## Modifications
- Normally this theme uses Google Fonts. I removed the Google fonts in order to improve load time and fix some formatting issues. In order to switch [System Font Stack](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) I modified the following files:

In [`_theme.yml`](_data/theme.yml) I removed:

  ```YAML
  # Google Fonts
  google_fonts:
    - name: "Fira Sans"
      weights: "400,400i,600,600i"
  ```

In [`_variables.scss`](_sass/basically-basic/_variables.scss) I changed the `$base-font-family` line to read as follows:

  ```scss
  $base-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol" !default;
  ```

In [`head.html`](_includes/head.html) I removed:

  ```liquid
  {% if site.data.theme.google_fonts %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family={% for font in site.data.theme.google_fonts %}{{ font.name | replace: ' ', '+' }}{% if font.weights %}:{% endif %}{{ font.weights | remove: ' ' }}{% if forloop.last != true %}|{% endif %}{% endfor %}">
  {% endif %}
  ```

All of these changes improved the aesthetic and load time. Plus it helped make the mobile `site.title` more responsive on mobile especially for longer titles.
