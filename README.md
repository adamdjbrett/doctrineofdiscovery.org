I have become frustrated with how slow and limited in accessibility WordPress is so I decided to start moving sites I administer over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because as static site generator it is faster, more reliable and I have more control over making it accessible..

## Getting Started

[![Tip @mmmistakes via PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-tip%20me-green.svg?logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.me/mmistakes).

I decided to go with @mmistakes theme [Basically Basic Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) because in [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). The theme has straight ðŸ’¯'s. If you are reading this stop by and check out the theme and/or support @mmistakes on PayPal.

a substitute for the default [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), with a

### Prerequisites

- Flat file
- static site
- no filler
- SSL
- Github Pages

## Built With
* [Basically Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/)
* [System Font Stack](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/)
* [Font Awesome 4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/)
* [Bootstrap CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

## Modifications
- Normally this theme uses Google Fonts. I removed the Google fonts in order to improve load time and fix some formatting issues. In order to switch [System Font Stack](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) I modified the following files:

In [`_theme.yml`](_data/theme.yml) I removed:

  ```YAML
  # Google Fonts
  google_fonts:
    - name: "Fira Sans"
      weights: "400,400i,600,600i"
  ```

In [`_variables.scss`](_sass/basically-basic/_variables.scss) I changed the `$base-font-family` line to read as follows:

  ```scss
  $base-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol" !default;
  ```

In [`head.html`](_includes/head.html) I removed:

  ```liquid
  {% if site.data.theme.google_fonts %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family={% for font in site.data.theme.google_fonts %}{{ font.name | replace: ' ', '+' }}{% if font.weights %}:{% endif %}{{ font.weights | remove: ' ' }}{% if forloop.last != true %}|{% endif %}{% endfor %}">
  {% endif %}
  ```

All of these changes improved the aesthetic and load time. Plus it helped make the mobile `site.title` more responsive on mobile especially for longer titles.
