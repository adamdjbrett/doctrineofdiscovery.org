### Michael E. Chaness

Dr. Michael E. Chaness -- I am currently a visiting assistant professor at SUNY-Oswego where I teach courses in Anthropology and Native American Studies. Previous to that appointment I earned my Ph.D. in the department of religion at Syracuse University under the tutelage of Dr. Philip Arnold. It was while living in Syracuse that I began to collaborate with onkwehonwe peoples. Throughout my graduate studies I worked simultaneously at the Onondaga Nation School and the relationships I cultivated at ONS lead directly to many years of (ongoing) informal fieldwork. My scholarship explores the intersections between Jewish American and Native American identity creation through the prisms of blood and land, philosophy and theology, gender and genocide, religion and ritual. I see this conference as an opportunity to focus attention on the insidiousness of the doctrine of Christian discovery so that we may uproot, expose, and begin to dismantle the legacies of white supremacy that have become entrenched throughout America's religious, legal, and political institutions. May this process, as our Haudenosaunee friends say, bring our minds together as one.

### Cristofer Fernández, OFM Conv.
[Cristofer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristofer-m-fern%C3%A1ndez-ofm-conv-7733a2105/) holds a B.S. in Environmental & Conservation Biology from George Mason University and a M.A. in Theology, Religion, and Culture Studies from the Catholic University of America. He is in his final year of initial formation as a student-friar with the Conventual Franciscans (OFM Conv.), a religious order of the Catholic church. In his religious formation, Brother Cristofer is exploring the intersections between ethics, faith and science; religion, ecology and culture; the institutional church, social action and spirituality. He hopes to pursue a graduate degree in applied integrative ecology in the near future.

Over the years, Bro. Cristofer has developed enthusiasm and passion for understanding the interactions in nature, intersections between cultures, societies and the environment, and the role of humanity with respect to these relationships. He is interested in the conservation of ecosystems and preserving their services to local communities. Inspired by the line of instruction put forth in the Vatican teaching document, Laudato Si', Bro. Cristofer is interested in advancing his knowledge of conservation ecology and issues in the human dimensions of environment, rooting this in Catholic Social Teaching's framing of integral ecology. He is excited about advancing conversations and religious involvement in community-based conservation, developing cosmographies (applied cosmovisions/sense of place praxis) that learn from Indigenous peoples, environmental conflict mitigation, and addressing the nexus between poverty, environment, and religion. He hopes to accomplish this through immersive learning experiences, involvement in community-based projects, and by educating and empowering youth and communities from all walks of life to undergo an 'ecological conversion', to become involved in ecosocial works and to become ecologically literate citizens.

### Joel Harrison
[Joel Harrison](https://joelharrison.academia.edu/) is Associate Professor of Religion at Northern Virginia Community College in Manassas, VA. He holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Northwestern University. His work is focused on the relationship between theology and social theory at the turn of the 20th century in Germany and theory and method in the early history of religious studies. His dissertation, Between Normativity and History: Ernst Troeltsch's Mystic Type and the Creative Possibility of Values, reads the "mystic type" in Troeltsch's theological sociology of the Church as a way of understanding his later work in the philosophy of history, particularly his solution to the problem of history and normativity. The dissertation argues that the "mystic type" can be understood philosophically, rather than historically or sociologically, and that a philosophical account of Troeltsch's mystic sheds new light on how he understands the development of Christian authority in history, showing how it is possible for norms to maintain authority while in a continual process of change.

His current project is an analysis of the underground Christian music scenes of the 90s and early 2000s through the lenses of social theory, political theology, and Troeltschean theology of culture. Tentatively titled Palms of Victory, Crowns of Glory: Evangelical Political Identity and Underground Christian Punk, the project traces the ways the underground Christian music scene, roughly 1994-2005, formed Christians politically and intellectually as American culture transitioned into a post-9/11 age. Of special interest is how leftist punk aesthetics were fully embraced in some circles and, thus, pushed evangelicalism in a progressive direction, and in others, "punk" was repurposed for more conservative political ends. The project connects the Christian punk/ska/emo/post-hardcore scenes all the way back to the Jesus Movement and the conservative political activism of suburban OC evangelicals in the 1960s, but also highlights the important ways it diverged from those movements and produced its own political consciousness.

Joel also holds a BA in English Education from California State University, Long Beach, an MA in English from the University of Northern Colorado, an MA in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary, and an MA in Religious Studies from Northwestern. Areas of specialization: 19th and early 20th century German philosophy, social and critical theory, ecclesiology, theology of culture.

### James (Jim) Perkinson

Ecumenical Theological Seminary, Theology and Ethics, Faculty Member.

Jim Perkinson is a long-time activist and educator from inner city Detroit, where he has a history of involvement in various community development initiatives and low-income housing projects. He holds a PhD in theology/history of religions from the University of Chicago, is the author of White Theology: Outing Supremacy in Modernity and Shamanism, Racism, and Hip-Hop Culture: Essays on White Supremacy and Black Subversion, and has written extensively in both academic and popular journals on questions of race, class and colonialism in connection with religion and urban culture. He is in demand as a speaker on a wide variety of topics related to his interests and a recognized artist on the spoken-word poetry scene in the inner city. 

Jim is interested in using a broad array of interdisciplinary tools to investigate the way socio-economic position, racial presupposition, and gender perspective already inform our values and orientation to life long before we begin to grapple with questions of identity, ministry or spirituality. He is particularly concerned to understand the way white supremacy, as an effect of colonial Christian practices, continues to be reproduced in mainstream Western cultures. In addition, he explores how the creative forms of cultural resistance developed by marginalized groups can critically challenge Christianity today. These concerns figure in both his academic writing and the performance poetry that he produce as a necessary adjunct to teaching. Becoming at least bi-cultural in communication skills and poly-rhythmic in spiritual practice is fast emerging as a requisite capacity for Christian leadership in a transnational world. And the need for a pedagogy adequate to such a demand is his consuming passion.

​I am an ABD doctoral student in Philosophy at the University of Connecticut, under the supervision of Heather Battaly and Tracy Llanera.
 
My dissertation explores the intersection of extremism and gender—specifically, the role and presence of women in the American far-right. Women’s roles in the far-right have often been dismissed, ignored, or counted as 'feminist' wins despite the regressive content of their beliefs. My dissertation focuses on the ways in which we exculpate these women in discussions of moral responsibility, and proposes an alternative understanding of both backward- and forward-looking moral responsibility based in intersectional feminist theory.
 
Aside from my dissertation, I work on projects in the field of virtue and vice epistemology.

### Terry Reeder
Terry Hawley Reeder, PhD, Visiting Assistant Professor of Religious Studies, College of Wooster

Indigenous values inform all of my work. My teaching and research have three strands: one is investigating howpatriarchal Christianities misuse natural law in the American public sphere to provoke animus against queer people and women. Second, I identify how religions, primarily Christianities and Indigenous sacred practices, promote liberation or oppression, including teaching about the Doctrine of Discovery. Last, I work with Harriet Jacob's *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* as a text for the study of religions.
