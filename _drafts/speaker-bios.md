### Michael E. Chaness

Dr. Michael E. Chaness -- I am currently a visiting assistant professor at SUNY-Oswego where I teach courses in Anthropology and Native American Studies. Previous to that appointment I earned my Ph.D. in the department of religion at Syracuse University under the tutelage of Dr. Philip Arnold. It was while living in Syracuse that I began to collaborate with onkwehonwe peoples. Throughout my graduate studies I worked simultaneously at the Onondaga Nation School and the relationships I cultivated at ONS lead directly to many years of (ongoing) informal fieldwork. My scholarship explores the intersections between Jewish American and Native American identity creation through the prisms of blood and land, philosophy and theology, gender and genocide, religion and ritual. I see this conference as an opportunity to focus attention on the insidiousness of the doctrine of Christian discovery so that we may uproot, expose, and begin to dismantle the legacies of white supremacy that have become entrenched throughout America's religious, legal, and political institutions. May this process, as our Haudenosaunee friends say, bring our minds together as one.

### Cristofer Fernández, OFM Conv.
[Cristofer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristofer-m-fern%C3%A1ndez-ofm-conv-7733a2105/) holds a B.S. in Environmental & Conservation Biology from George Mason University and a M.A. in Theology, Religion, and Culture Studies from the Catholic University of America. He is in his final year of initial formation as a student-friar with the Conventual Franciscans (OFM Conv.), a religious order of the Catholic church. In his religious formation, Brother Cristofer is exploring the intersections between ethics, faith and science; religion, ecology and culture; the institutional church, social action and spirituality. He hopes to pursue a graduate degree in applied integrative ecology in the near future.

Over the years, Bro. Cristofer has developed enthusiasm and passion for understanding the interactions in nature, intersections between cultures, societies and the environment, and the role of humanity with respect to these relationships. He is interested in the conservation of ecosystems and preserving their services to local communities. Inspired by the line of instruction put forth in the Vatican teaching document, Laudato Si', Bro. Cristofer is interested in advancing his knowledge of conservation ecology and issues in the human dimensions of environment, rooting this in Catholic Social Teaching's framing of integral ecology. He is excited about advancing conversations and religious involvement in community-based conservation, developing cosmographies (applied cosmovisions/sense of place praxis) that learn from Indigenous peoples, environmental conflict mitigation, and addressing the nexus between poverty, environment, and religion. He hopes to accomplish this through immersive learning experiences, involvement in community-based projects, and by educating and empowering youth and communities from all walks of life to undergo an 'ecological conversion', to become involved in ecosocial works and to become ecologically literate citizens.

### Joel Harrison
[Joel Harrison](https://joelharrison.academia.edu/) is Associate Professor of Religion at Northern Virginia Community College in Manassas, VA. He holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Northwestern University. His work is focused on the relationship between theology and social theory at the turn of the 20th century in Germany and theory and method in the early history of religious studies. His dissertation, Between Normativity and History: Ernst Troeltsch's Mystic Type and the Creative Possibility of Values, reads the "mystic type" in Troeltsch's theological sociology of the Church as a way of understanding his later work in the philosophy of history, particularly his solution to the problem of history and normativity. The dissertation argues that the "mystic type" can be understood philosophically, rather than historically or sociologically, and that a philosophical account of Troeltsch's mystic sheds new light on how he understands the development of Christian authority in history, showing how it is possible for norms to maintain authority while in a continual process of change.

His current project is an analysis of the underground Christian music scenes of the 90s and early 2000s through the lenses of social theory, political theology, and Troeltschean theology of culture. Tentatively titled Palms of Victory, Crowns of Glory: Evangelical Political Identity and Underground Christian Punk, the project traces the ways the underground Christian music scene, roughly 1994-2005, formed Christians politically and intellectually as American culture transitioned into a post-9/11 age. Of special interest is how leftist punk aesthetics were fully embraced in some circles and, thus, pushed evangelicalism in a progressive direction, and in others, "punk" was repurposed for more conservative political ends. The project connects the Christian punk/ska/emo/post-hardcore scenes all the way back to the Jesus Movement and the conservative political activism of suburban OC evangelicals in the 1960s, but also highlights the important ways it diverged from those movements and produced its own political consciousness.

Joel also holds a BA in English Education from California State University, Long Beach, an MA in English from the University of Northern Colorado, an MA in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary, and an MA in Religious Studies from Northwestern. Areas of specialization: 19th and early 20th century German philosophy, social and critical theory, ecclesiology, theology of culture.

### Terry Reeder

Hello, I am Terry Reeder PhD. I am an anti-racist feminist who has taught Religious Studies and Ethics at multiple colleges including Syracuse University, Nazareth College, St. John Fisher, the College of St. Rose and LeMoyne College. I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at the College of Wooster in Ohio. As a Catholic high school Religion teacher I became increasingly unable to live with the social justice violations that I was complicit with as a Catholic educator. This includes the Doctrine of Discovery. The year that I became a grandmother I began a doctoral program in Religion at Syracuse University. At SU I  studied the ethics of Christianity and ways to deconstruct and dismantle religious colonialism and sexism in order to  build a more just world. For me the most important way to grow in justice  is to learn from Indigenous teachers. I try to balance my scholarship with activism, and to continually decolonize myself, my pedagogy, and my religion.  It is an honor to be at this conference learning from and with these esteemed teachers and other participants.
