name: "Telma Alencar"
bio: "MA Social Anthropology /Ph.D. Social & Political Thought in progress at York University, Canada.  
Telma's research focuses on identifying the intersections of the Doctrine of Discovery with the destruction of one of the world's most important ecosystems - the Amazon forest, through the ongoing violence against indigenous people in Brazil for the exploitation of natural resources for profit.
Telma's research draws on neocolonialism studies as a theoretical framework, also focusing on intersections between Christianity and Global Capitalism, aiming at shedding light on the Doctrine of Discovery's effects and legacy related to the Global South, specifically to Brazilian Indigenous communities."
