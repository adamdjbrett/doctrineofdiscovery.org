Excerpt:

> While visiting with President and Director of the [American Indian Law Alliance Betty Lyons](https://aila.ngo) prior to the start of the recent Haudenosaunee Doctrine of Discovery conference, I was advised that the United States would certainly be run a lot differently if it were part of that confederacy. “We would never allow in our nation what’s happening in the United States right now. Our women have the power to put our leaders up, and to take them down when they’re not doing their duties and responsibilities. So, all of those positions are not ones of power and prestige, they’re positions of responsibility.”
