## Analysis by Steven T. Newcomb
*   [White v. University of California (9th Cir., 2014) - Domination Translator Series - Part 10](/blog/domination/white-university-of-california-9th-circuit/)


## Key Excerpt:

>   “Aboriginal interest in land generally is described as a tribe’s right to occupy the land.  It is not a property right, but “amounts to a right of occupancy which the sovereign grants and protects against the interests of third parties.”  That right, which is residual in nature, comes from the legal theory that **discovery and conquest gave the conquerors the right to own the land** but did not disturb the tribe’s right to occupy it. “  _Id_., at 1015.  (Emphasis added.)
