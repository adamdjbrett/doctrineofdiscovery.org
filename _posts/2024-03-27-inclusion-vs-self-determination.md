But questions nagged at me:

When colonized people participate in the politics of their colonizer, does that signify the end of colonialism or its successful culmination?

Does the appointment of a ‘Native American’ to high office in the US government signify the ultimate success of the assimilation project?

What does such an appointment signify about the relationship between the US and Original peoples?
