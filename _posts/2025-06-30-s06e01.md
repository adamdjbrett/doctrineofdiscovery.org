## Special Episode
This episode is a live recording of *The Doctrine of Christian Discovery, The Jesuits, and Laudato si: Defending Mother Earth* an educational event that took place on Saturday, June 14, 2025 from 1:00-4:00PM. This event seredepitiously coincided with the #NoKings protests which were happening across the nation. 

The event at the [Skä•noñh &emdash; Great Law of Peace Center](https://www.skanonhcenter.org/) focused on the [Doctrine of Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/), the Jesuits, and Laudato Si. Speakers discussed the Thanksgiving address, emphasizing gratitude and respect for nature. Philip P. Arnold highlighted the Jesuits' role in colonization and the need for Jesuit institutions to address their history. Christiana Zenner and Kim Carrefour stressed the importance of indigenous knowledge and environmental justice. Oren Lyons and Jake Edwards underscored the significance of the Great Tree of Peace and the need for world peace. The discussion concluded with a call for Jesuit institutions to educate on their historical impact and promote reconciliation. The discussion centers on the challenges faced by Native American communities in preserving their traditions and sovereignty. Speakers highlight the impact of colonial hierarchies and the suppression of indigenous practices. They emphasize the importance of language revitalization, food sovereignty, and traditional practices. Historical accounts of forced assimilation, such as the Sullivan Clinton campaign of 1779, are recounted, illustrating the violent suppression of Native cultures. The conversation also touches on the significance of treaties, the role of Christian missionaries, and the need for land return to foster environmental and cultural healing.
