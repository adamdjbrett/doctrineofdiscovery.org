> Sandy Bigtree & Philip Arnold - The Religious Origins of White Supremacy
> 
> Today’s discussion is one of profound importance, and I am honored to speak with my guests. Sandy Bigtree is a citizen of the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne. She was a founding board member of the American Indian Law Alliance, and a founding board member of the Indigenous Values Initiative. Sandy was also an original Planning Committee member of the Skä•noñh: Great Law of Peace Center and currently sits on the Educational Collaborative committee.

> Sandy’s husband is Dr. Philip P. Arnold. Phil serves as President of the Indigenous Values Initiative. He is an associate Professor of Religion at Syracuse University, and he is the Founding Director of the Skä·noñh—Great Law of Peace Center, which is a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Cultural Center focused on telling the story of the native peoples of central New York.

> In this episode, we explore the religious origins of white supremacy; the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and its impact on Western democracy, women’s rights, and environmental justice; and the Skä·noñh—Great Law of Peace Center.
