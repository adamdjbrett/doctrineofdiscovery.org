This foundational decolonization webinar addresses the Doctrine of Discovery, the intersection between indigenous and environmental struggles, facing the challenges of neocolonialism (i.e., the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)) and the forced disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students that remains in impunity.

Organized by the NLG Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ Rights Committee and the NLG Environmental Human Rights Committee
