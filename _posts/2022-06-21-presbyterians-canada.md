## In 2019 the Presbyterian Church in Canada Repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery

The Presbyterian Church in Canada [Justice Ministries](https://presbyterian.ca/justice/) has prepared a report, including a theological reflection, regarding the Doctrine of Discovery and _terra nullius_ as part of its 2019 report to General Assembly. The report includes a recommendation, in line with [Call to Action 46ii of the Truth and Reconciliation Comission](https://presbyterian.ca/healing/trc-calls-to-action/), that The Presbyterian Church in Canada should repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery. You can find resources regarding the Doctrine of Discovery, including links to videos, a webinar, some study questions and further reading below.
