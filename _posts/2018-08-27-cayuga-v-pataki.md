Excerpt:

>   “We understand [_Sherrill_](/sherrill-v-oneida-opinion-of-the-court/) to hold that equitable doctrines, such as laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, can in appropriate circumstances, be applied to Indian land claims, **even when such a claim is legally viable and with in the statute of limitations** …  

> **One of the few incontestable propositions about this unusually complex and confusing area of law is that doctrines and categorizations applicable to other areas do not translate neatly to these claims.”**
