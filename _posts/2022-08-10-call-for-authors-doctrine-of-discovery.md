We are now accepting applications for partnership and collaboration with The Doctrine of Discovery Project. We are interested in publishing original essays roughly 1,000-3,000 words in length for [doctrineofdiscovery.org](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/). Applicants must have specific knowledge pertaining to Indigenous Peoples issues and/or graduate level training in religious studies, law, humanities, social sciences, or ecology. This partnership is open to faculty, independent scholars, graduate students and Haudenosaunee and Indigenous knowledge sharers. Stipends are available.

Interested authors should submit a 150-300 word abstract, a 150–300 word biography, your resume/cv (if available), and a sample of a previous published article no later than September 30, 2022. The goal of this partnership is to support and amplify Indigenous voices pertaining to the Doctrine of Discovery, so priority will be given to Indigenous Peoples working in this area.

Each essay should be geared towards an interested and engaged public and undergraduate audience. Our first high-priority interest is in the following core topics:

*   200 Years of Johnson v. M’Intosh (JvM): Indigenous Responses to the Religious Foundations of Racism
*   The Doctrine of Discovery and Law
*   The religious dimensions of the Doctrine of Discovery
*   The Doctrine of Discovery as a global phenomenon (international)
*   The environmental impact of the Doctrine of Discovery
*   Doctrine of Discovery and Indian Boarding/Residential Schools
*   And other Doctrine of Discovery related topics.

Authors will be notified whether their proposals are accepted by October 1, 2022. First drafts or full essays are due by December 1, 2022, and final versions are due January 15, 2022. All authors must note their educational and social background in their biographies. Only original previously unpublished works will be considered.
