In this episode, Jeannine Hill Fletcher confronts how white Christian institutions cultivated racial hierarchy—through indoctrination, forced conversion, marriage policies, and inherited land theft—to sever Indigenous matrilineal bonds and dismantle ties to land, arguing that justice demands reckoning with those systems and our complicity, as explored in her works *Grace of the Ghosts: A Theology of Institutional Reparation* and *The Sin of White Supremacy: Christianity, Racism, and Religious Diversity in America*.
