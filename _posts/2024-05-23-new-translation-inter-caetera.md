> Translation differences between this new translation and Davenport's occur more often in tone than in content. Of the latter, the most important is probably this: When discussing the religious aims of these expeditions and conquests, the pope states that it is a priority for him that those barbarian peoples *ad fidem ipsam reducantur*, which Davenport translates as being "brought to the faith itself." However, since the semantics of the verb *reducere* carry an element of 'back/return' due to its prefix 're-', we decided to translate the clause as "bringing them back to the faith", the implications of which Sebastian Modrow is exploring in a separate piece of scholarship. With slight variations, this papal request to return the local populations to the true faith occurs multiple times throughout the bull.
