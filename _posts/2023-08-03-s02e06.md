> In our latest podcast episode, we embark on an enlightening journey with [Rev. Dr. Brian Konkol](https://chancellor.syr.edu/university-leadership-2/chancellors-council/brian-konkol/), Dean of Hendricks Chapel at Syracuse University and professor of practice. Konkol, with his unique global perspective and methodology of accompaniment, offers a fresh outlook on Christianity, focusing on its potential to foster connectivity and unity rather than division.
