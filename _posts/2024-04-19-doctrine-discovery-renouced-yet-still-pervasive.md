> To its credit, on March 30, 2023, the Vatican renounced the Doctrine. The attempt to right past wrongs is justified not just for moral reasons, but also because it bears heavily on efforts to avert the worst impacts of climate change. Indigenous land rights have been recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and in numerous scientific studies as a bulwark against tropical deforestation and biodiversity extinction.

> Pope Francis’s courage in annulling the Doctrine of Discovery should be applauded and celebrated; it is a breakthrough as we contend with the damage wrought by these papal bulls and the colonial legacies across the centuries. Nevertheless, bold as this decision might have been, the principles promoted by the Doctrine are still embedded in national laws and court decisions, and those laws and cases pose formidable barriers to righting the wrongs of the past.

> For example, the first Congress of the United States implemented the Doctrine of Discovery on July 22, 1790, to enact a law, still in effect to this day, that claimed U.S. ownership rights over the lands of Native American Nations. The U.S. Supreme Court completely adopted this international legal principle of colonialism in Johnson v. McIntosh in 1823.
> 
> The Doctrine has served as a legal justification not only for seizing Native American lands, but also for blocking subsequent Native Nations’ efforts to reclaim their lands. In 2005, in a Supreme Court decision authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Doctrine was invoked as a justification for denying the efforts of the Oneida Nation and its people to reclaim a portion of their sovereignty and lands, and in 2010 a federal judge relied on the Oneida ruling to dismiss the Onondaga Nation’s land rights action.
