From Land Theft To Land Back The OAS And The Onondaga Nation Land Rights Action
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This panel, including Tadodaho Sidney Hill, will review the history of intentional land thefts of Onondaga and Haudenosaunee homelands from the 1780s to the 1820s; the shameful dismissal of the Onondaga's Land Rights Action in the federal court, which was based upon the doctrine of Christian discovery and domination; and the Nation's successful effort to accuse the U.S. of human rights violations in the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Last May, the Nation achieved a historic ruling by the Commission as the first Indigenous nation to achieve the merits stage in the Commission, which will result in a substantive ruling on the human rights failures by the U.S.
