## Introduction

I thank Steve Ward and the [Rev. Dr. Suzannah Rohman](https://standrewsnewcastle.org/staff/suzannah-rohman/) for inviting me to preach this morning. My sermon is titled "Living into Christ's Great Commandment, Our Baptismal Covenant, and the Biblical Imperative to Do Justice: How Do We Stand in Solidarity with Wabanaki  Nations?"  This  is  the  tenth  congregation  that  I  have  preached  to  within  the  Episcopal Diocese of Maine spanning from Cumberland County to The County.

Though we find ourselves in the midst of the longest liturgical season of the year, Pentecost, we  are  also celebrating the Season of Creation. All the  lessons we  heard this morning reverberated  with  the  theme  of  creation,  God's  animating  life  force,  and  how  thankful  we  should be for God's creation. The theme for this year's Season of Creation is "Let Justice and Peace Flow." I most certainly want to talk to you this morning about justice. You may be aware that each of the Sundays within the Season of Creation has a theme. For this Sunday, it is advocate. In addition to justice, I will talk to you this morning about how we as settlers can be effective advocates to stand in solidarity with Wabanaki Nations.

I  preach  to  you  today  conscious  of  rising  public  expressions  of  hate, anti-semitism,  white supremacy, and racism within the State of Maine. All of the beliefs, ideas, and meanings associated  with  those  words  or  terms  run  counter  to  the  core  of  our  faith,  to  love  our  neighbor, to "strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being," and "to do justice."  Though we  haven't heard of many reports of  hate directed at the  Wabanaki, don't believe for a second that they are not vulnerable to this same violence.

If you don't recognize those references to our faith, I am referring when citing "love our neighbor" to the Great Commandment which you can find in three of the Gospels, [Matthew](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2022%3A35â€)  [22:35--40](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2022%3A35â€),  [Mark  12:28--34,](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Mark%2012%3A28â€)  and  [Luke  10:27a.](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke%2010%3A27&version=nrsv)  As  it appears  in  Mathew,  "'You  shall  love  the  Lord your  God with all your  heart, and with all your soul, and with all your  mind.' This is the greatest and  first  commandment.  And  the  second  is  like  it:  'You  shall  love  your  neighbor  as  yourself.'  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

The passage "Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being" constitutes part of our Baptismal Covenant when we answer in response  to  the  celebrant's  query,  "I  will,  with  God's  help."  We  don't  pledge  sometimes,  when we feel like it, when it is convenient. We say, "I will."

We  have  all of those  faith-filled prophets  of the Old Testament calling us to "do justice." I began a sermon that I preached at St. Anne's Episcopal Church in Calais in June 2018 with multiple references to prophets exhorting us to "do justice" in case anyone in the congregation was thinking, why is this guy bringing this liberal political stuff into our church? Recall at the beginning  of  this  sermon  I  told  you  the  theme  for  this  Season  of  Justice  is "Let  Justice  and  Peace Flow." It is inspired by Amos, "But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never- failing stream!" (Amos 5:24)

Many  of  us  are  fond  of  that  passage  from  Amos.  But  we  can  find  that  same  message  from other prophets.

Micah  6:8  New  Revised  Standard  Version (NRSV)
==================================================
>
>^8^  He  has  told  you,  O  mortal,  what  is  good; and  what  does  the  LORD  require  of  you
>
> but  to  do  justice,  and  to  love  kindness, and  to walk  humbly with  your  God?
>

Isaiah  1:17  New  Revised  Standard  Version (NRSV)
====================================================
> 
> ^17^     learn  to  do  good; seek justice,
> 
> rescue  the  oppressed, defend the orphan,
> 
> plead  for  the  widow.

I  assume  all of us gathered here  this morning strive  to follow the  example  of Jesus Christ and  call  ourselves  Christians.  According  to  Wikipedia  [(Christianity by Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_by_country)), Christianity has more adherents than any other religion in the world estimated at 2.38 billion people out of a human population of 8 billion. Yet we know Christians have a range of views about key tenets of our faith. Some read the Bible as the literal Word of God. Others, including Episcopalians, read scripture as the inspired Word of God with a faithful reading of Gospel passages requiring reason, historical understanding, and prayer. Biblical texts have deep meanings at time requiring more than an instructions-manual or cookbook approach to understanding them. We well know interpreting Biblical passages can be challenging. Yet we have movements within Christianity rejecting what some of us might believe constitute core principles of our faith.

National Public Radio conducted an interview earlier this year with Russell Moore, formerly  one  of  the  top  officials  of  the  Southern  Baptist  Convention.  In  an  excerpt  from  a  story filed from the interview, he says:
> 
> It was the result of having multiple  pastors tell me, essentially, the  same story about  quoting  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount,  parenthetically,  in  their  preaching  ---
> 
> "turn  the  other  cheek" --- [and]  to  have  someone  come  up  after  to  say,  "Where  did you  get  those  liberal  talking  points?"  And  what  was  alarming  to  me  is  that  in  most of  these  scenarios,  when the  pastor  would  say,  "I'm  literally  quoting  Jesus  Christ," the response would not be, "I apologize." The response would be, "Yes, but that doesn't work anymore. That's weak." And when we get to the point where the teachings of Jesus himself are seen as subversive to us, then we're in a crisis. (NPR,  "He  was  a  top  church  official  who  criticized  Trump.  He  says  Christianity  is in crisis," 8/8/23 [https://www.npr.org/2023/08/08/1192663920/southern-baptist-](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/08/1192663920/southern-baptist-convention-donald-trump-christianity)  [convention-donald-trump-christianity](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/08/1192663920/southern-baptist-convention-donald-trump-christianity))

Human  beings  have  often  selectively  quoted  from  sacred  texts  to  justify  their  actions.

Does  anyone  remember  this  chilling  dialogue  from  the  1982  movie [*Sophie's  Choice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice_(film))?  To  remind you,  Sophie's  Choice  depicts  the  horrible  decision  thrust  on  the  title  character  when  a  SS  officer asks her to choose her son or daughter to be exterminated in the Nazi gas chambers.
> 
> **SS  officer**:  You  believe  in  Christ  the [redeemer](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Redeemer)?
> 
> **Sophie**:  Yes.
> 
> **SS  officer**:  Did  He  not  say...  "Suffer  the  [children,](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Children)  come  unto  me?"  You  may  keep  one  of your children.
> 
> **Sophie**:  I  beg your  pardon?
> 
> **SS  officer**: You  may keep  one  of  your children.  The  other  must go away.

I want to return to the social climate in our state. As these public demonstrations, race- and anti-semitic-related graffiti, and flyers become more common in this State, some people might  dismiss  them  saying  "they  don't  truly  reflect us,  at  least  the  majority"  or  "this  is  not  who we  are  in  Maine."  A  recently published  op-ed in  the  Bangor  Daily News explored this premise.

> As unique, and prophetically accepting as our state must be, if there is no place  for white supremacy in Maine, why are there [so many](https://www.pressherald.com/2023/07/23/hate-groups-are-on-the-march-in-maine/)  of them throughout the beautiful,  mostly  rural  state  of  Maine?... If  we  do not  want  Maine  to  be  a  state  that is  a  host to  the parasite  of hatred, how  did we  get  here?  Then,  we  pose:  if possible,

how  do  we  move  forward?  (Bangor  Daily  News,  9/15/23,  Raymond  Diamond,  "If there are so many hate groups in Maine, maybe this is who we are")

The  prophet  Isaiah  has  an  answer  to  the  writer's  rhetorical  question,  "learn  to  do  good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed." (Isaiah 1:17 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV))

What  does  the  rising  climate  of  hate  in  Maine  have  to  do with  the  struggle  to  have  Maine State Government and many other settler institutions fully and unconditionally acknowledge Wabanaki sovereignty or the right to self-determination? The attempted domination and destruction of the Original Peoples and Nations of this land we today call Maine was morally, religiously, legally, and politically justified by a concept that originated in Christianity, the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination, and it became accepted international law. At its core, the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination reflects a mindset of white supremacy and racism. I initially preached about it on the Sunday before Indigenous Peoples' Day  in  2006  when I  called  upon  my  home  parish,  St.  James'  Episcopal  Church  in  Old  Town,  the Episcopal Diocese of Maine, the entire Episcopal Church, and the Anglican Communion to repudiate it. The good news is the first three have taken that action.

For those of you unfamiliar with the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination, it constitutes a worldview and legal concept that espouses Christians have a right and justification because of their religious faith to invade non-Christian lands not in the possession of any other Christians and take control of those lands and the property of those peoples and if the original inhabitants  don't  submit  to  the  Christian  conquerors  the  invaders  can  enslave  them  and  kill  them. Sound shocking? Unbelievable? Skeptical? Thinking where did this guy get this from? I got it from the leader of Christianity at the time, Pope Nicholas V.  In 1452, he issued the papal bull, think of a papal bull as a formal declaration from the pope, titled Dum Diversas.  It grants the king of Portugal the Pope's blessing to go to the western coast of Africa, and to ... "'capture, vanquish and subdue the Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ, and put them into perpetual slavery and to take all their possessions and their property.'"  Several other papal bulls declared this same right of discovery and domination along with numerous charters issued by English monarchs, including the Cabot Charter issued in 1496 by King Henry VII.

As more people have learned about the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination, a growing number of religious bodies have repudiated it including the Episcopal Church in 2009 in resolution D035 (https:/[/www.episcopalar](http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-)c[hives.org/cgi-](http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-) bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2009-D035). While many faith communities  are  grappling  with  the  Doctrine  of  Christian  Discovery  and  Domination,  it remains the foundation of Federal Indian Law, the:

> treaties, statutes, executive  orders, administrative decisions, and court cases -- that define  and  exemplify  the  unique  legal  and  political  status  of  the  over  550  federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, the relationship of tribes  with the federal government; and, the role of tribes and states in our federalism.  (NARF:  the  Native  American  Rights  Fund  Indian  Education  Legal  Support  Project "Tribalizing Indian Education" Federal Indian Law and Policy Affecting American Indian and Alaska Native Education, Oct. 2000 (https:/[/www.narf.org/w](http://www.narf.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/purple.pdf))o[rdpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/purple.pdf).](http://www.narf.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/purple.pdf))

Supreme Court Justice John Marshall used the concept in part as the legal reasoning for the 1823 Supreme Court decision *Johnson v. McIntosh*.  The brilliant Indigenous  scholar  Steve  Newcomb  writes  in *FIVE  HUNDRED  YEARS  OF  INJUSTICE: The Legacy of Fifteenth Century Religious Prejudice 1992*, "Writing for the unanimous court,  Chief  Justice  John  Marshall  observed  that  Christian  European  nations  had  assumed "ultimate dominion" over the lands of America during the Age of Discovery, and that-- upon "discovery"--the Indians had lost "their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations," and only retained a right of "occupancy" in their lands. In other words, Indian nations were subject to the ultimate authority of the first nation of Christendom to claim possession of a given region of Indian lands."

Wabanaki Nations, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Mi'kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe consisting of two communities, Motahkomikuk and Sipayik, and the Penobscot Nation, have been engaged in an epic campaign to have the State of Maine and many settler institutions recognize their inherent sovereignty. I purposefully used the term "inherent sovereignty." Inherent sovereignty means no entity outside the Wabanaki Nations confers sovereignty  upon  them.  Wabanaki  Nations  possess  sovereignty  as  part  of  their  original  existence.

Their  political  struggle  involves  achieving  State  of  Maine  legal  and  political  recognition  of  that inherent sovereignty.

Much of the political struggle concerning Wabanaki sovereignty centers on the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (MICSA), the 1980 law that includes a state law, the Maine Implementing Act, that was only made effective upon President Carter signing MICSA on October 10, 1980. The MICSA settled the lawsuit brought by the Dept. of Justice on behalf of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation in 1972 concerning illegal acquisition of land by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Maine in violation of the 1790 Nonintercourse  Act,  a  Federal  law  that  specifies  any  land  agreements  entered  into  by  states  must be approved by Congress. In other words, Congress, or the Federal Government, has primacy in governmental  relations  with  tribes,  not  state  governments. Congress  had  not  ratified  a  number  of Massachusetts and Maine land deals with the Wabanaki, thus putting legal title to two thirds of the State of Maine in question.

While MICSA effectively ended the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot lawsuit, it did not end the struggle over the tribes' inherent sovereignty. For the last three legislatures, the Wabanaki Alliance, a nonprofit organization created by the Wabanaki Nations in Maine in 2020, has  been  leading  the  effort  to  pass  22  recommended  changes  to  the  Maine Implementing  Act that resulted from a Task Force (<https://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf>) of state legislators, Wabanaki Chiefs, representative of the Governor's Office and Office of the Attorney General, and the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission. During the 129^th^ Legislature (2019- 2020), the bill died without a floor vote due to the interruption of the legislative session by the pandemic. A similar bill was introduced during the 130^th^ Legislature, LD 1626. It fully passed  the House and required one final vote in the Maine Senate but it died on the Appropriations  Table when legislative Democrats acquiesced to Gov. Mills' demand that they not send the bill  to her as she did not want to deal with the political consequences of her expected veto. This year a  bill  embodying  the  Task  Force  recommendations  has  been  introduced  a  third  time,  LD  2007 An Act to Advance Self-determination for Wabanaki Nations. It will be considered when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

People of St. Andrews', I appeal to you to have a bias towards action on the side of justice. There are dozens of constructive things you can do both collectively as a congregation and  individually  to  support  LD  2007,  other  Wabanaki-backed  legislative  initiatives,  and  to  stand with Wabanaki Nations. Given this is not the 18^th^ or 19^th^ century when two-hour sermons were common,  I  won't  describe  all  those  potential  actions  now.  You  have  a  great  resource  among  you in Steve Ward who is active with the Episcopal Committee on Indian Relations. Please confer with him. I am also available to talk to you, either to your vestry or any other group of St.

Andrews'  parishioners,  who  want  to  learn  how  you  can  be  meaningfully  involved  to  make  a difference. With Zoom, that is much easier compared to when we were  limited to in-person gatherings.

We know every one of us will die and shed this mortal coil. When God asks what kind of life  have  we  lived,  be  prepared  should  God  ask  did  you  stand  with  colonialism,  racism,  and  white supremacy, or did you stand with the Wabanaki? Amen.
