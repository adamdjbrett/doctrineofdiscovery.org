In this episode, Kimberly Carfore explores ecofeminist theology and its connections to the Doctrine of Discovery, examining how dominionist interpretations of Genesis 1:28 enabled centuries of exploitation from witch burnings to Indigenous land theft, while drawing on Haudenosaunee fire stewardship practices and creation stories to propose healing alternatives that replace theological dominion with mutual care, ultimately envisioning "Earth as Mother God" as a framework for reorienting Christianity toward holistic relationships with the natural world.
