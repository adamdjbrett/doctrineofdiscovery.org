> Under the “doctrine of discovery,” _County of Oneida_ v. _Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,_ 470 U.S. 226, 234 (1985) _(Oneida II),_ “fee title to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign–first the discovering European nation and later the original States and the United States,” _Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y._ v. _County of Oneida,_ 414 U.S. 661, 667 (1974) _(Oneida I)_. In the original 13 States, “fee title to Indian lands,” or “the pre-emptive right to purchase from the Indians, was in the State.” _Id._, at 670; see _Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y._ v. _New York_, 860 F.2d 1145, 1159—1167 (CA2 1988). Both before and after the adoption of the Constitution, New York State acquired vast tracts of land from Indian tribes through treaties it independently negotiated, without National Government participation. See Gunther, Governmental Power and New York Indian Lands–A Reassessment of a Persistent Problem of Federal-State Relations, 8 Buffalo L. Rev. 1, 4—6 (1959) (hereinafter Gunther).
