> Beginning in 2014, University Chancellor Kent Syverud initiated several measures honoring the Haudenosaunee. One of the measures is the University’s policy of opening public events acknowledging our connection to and respect for the Onondaga and the Haudenosaunee people.   The Haudenosaunee,  the People of the Longhouse, are the original inhabitants of the land we stand on.  Despite the often dramatic cultural clashes between European and native peoples, Haudenosaunee culture helped to shape our government, our national symbols, and even the Women's Rights Movement. Yet, relations between the United States and the Six Nations have been fraught with war, broken treaties, racism, and a long history of illegal land grabs that can be documented in maps and historical records. This chronology illustrates the history of that relationship with maps that tell the story in a way difficult to imagine from published histories.
