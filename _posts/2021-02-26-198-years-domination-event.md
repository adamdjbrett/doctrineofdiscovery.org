## **A Two Year Journey leading to the 200th Anniversary of the US Supreme Court Case _Johnson v. M'Intosh_**

It has been 198 years since the US Supreme Court issued the _Johnson v. M'inTosh_ decision of 1823.

### On **February 28, 2021, 1-4PM (Pacific Standard Time)**

[REDTHOUGHT.org](http://Redthought.org) is sponsoring a free screening of _The Doctrine of Discovery: Unmasking the Domination Code, _directed by Sheldon Wolfchild (Dakota) and co-produced by Steven Newcomb (Shawnee/Lenape). Register at **[REDTHOUGHT.org](http://Redthought.org)** **(an online event).**

This will kick off a two year educational campaign about the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination. That campaign will end on February 28, 2023.

On February 28, 1823, the US Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in the case _Johnson v. Graham's Lessee v M'Intosh_, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543\. The claim of a right of domination ("ultimate dominion") which is expressed in the_Johnson _ruling, has been used against original nations and peoples in the United States and in many other parts of the world.

After the one hour screening, there will be a two-hour panel with Sheldon Wolfchild, Steven Newcomb, Buffy Sainte Marie (Cree), Dr. Luis Rivera-Pagán, a theologian from Puerto Rico, JoDe Goudy (Yakama Nation), Steve Schwartzberg, and Shawna Bluestar Newcomb (Shawnee/Lenape/Azteca), and Peter d'Errico, professor emeritus UMass/Amherst.
