### Minute 15.22.03. Doctrine of Discovery
* a) repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery, and its theological foundations as a relic of colonialism, feudalism, and religious, cultural, and racial biases that have no place in the treatment of First Peoples; and
* b) affirm the [World Council of Churches “Statement on the Doctrine of Discovery Impact on Indigenous Peoples”](/world-council-of-churches/), and encourage its consideration in the Church and, in particular, in theological colleges. (Agreement)
