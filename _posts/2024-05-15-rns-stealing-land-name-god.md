## **What's a 15th-century statement from a pope have to do with U.S. land policy today?**

In this conversation, Amanda Henderson and Steven Newcomb dive deeper into how the founding documents of the U.S. contain a claim of a God-ordained right for Christians to take land from non-Christians, which continues to be used as legal precedent in today's world. Together, they advocate for a more inclusive and holistic approach to social and political change, one that acknowledges and respects Indigenous perspectives and sovereignty.
