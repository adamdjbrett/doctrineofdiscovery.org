In this episode of the Mapping the Doctrine of Discovery podcast, hosts Phil Arnold and Sandy Bigtree interview [Robert P. Jones](https://www.prri.org/staff/robert-p-jones-ph-d/), the President and Founder of [Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)](https://www.prri.org/). Jones discusses his background as a scholar and writer, and how he has evolved to incorporate personal narratives into his work. He also talks about his new book, [*"The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and the Path Toward a Shared American Future,"*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-hidden-roots-of-white-supremacy-and-the-path-to-a-shared-american-future-robert-p-jones/19726759?aid=56272&ean=9781668009512&listref=whitetoolong-newsletter-bookshelf) which explores the history of white supremacy in American Christianity. Jones emphasizes the importance of truth-telling and cross-cultural conversations in addressing the legacy of white supremacy and working towards a more equitable future. The hosts also discuss the significance of shifting from Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day and the need for a broader understanding of American history that includes the contributions and perspectives of Indigenous and African-American peoples.
