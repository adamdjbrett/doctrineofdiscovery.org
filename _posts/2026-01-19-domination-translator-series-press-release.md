FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## The Doctrine of Discovery Project Launches The Domination Translator Series
### A 15-Part Extended Essay Analyzing How U.S. Courts Have Applied the Doctrine of Discovery

**Syracuse, New York** — January 19, 2026 — The Doctrine of Discovery Project is pleased to announce the launch of [**The Domination Translator Series**](/blog/domination/domination-translator-series-introduction/) by [Steven T. Newcomb](authors/steven-newcomb), a comprehensive 15-part extended essay examining the historical and ongoing impact of the [Doctrine of Discovery](/) on United States legal jurisprudence.

### About The Domination Translator Series

[**The Domination Translator Series**](/blog/domination/domination-translator-series-introduction/)  provides an in-depth analysis of how the Doctrine of Discovery—a medieval principle of Christian supremacy used to justify European colonization—has shaped American law from the founding of the republic to the present day. Through detailed examination of landmark Supreme Court cases, presidential doctrines, and legal precedents, the series demonstrates how this doctrine continues to underpin federal Indian law and property rights.

### Significance

This series makes a critical contribution to understanding how the Doctrine of Discovery—initially a tool of medieval European colonization—became embedded in American constitutional law and continues to affect indigenous peoples and their rights today. By tracing these cases from 1810 to the present, the analysis reveals both the persistence of discovery doctrine and emerging legal challenges to its legitimacy.
