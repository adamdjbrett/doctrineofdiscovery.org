> The “Doctrine of Christian Discovery” podcast—produced in collaboration with Syracuse University and Indigenous Values Initiative—explores how a 15th-century Christian doctrine encouraged conquest and colonization of non-Christians. The podcast also unpacks how its legacies still affect various lands and peoples, including the United States.
> 
> “The Doctrines of Christian Discovery (DoCD) originate with 15th century Papal Bulls that were issued by the Vatican and implemented by Monarchies, sanctioning the brutal Conquest and Colonization of non-Christians who were deemed ‘enemies of Christ’ in Africa and the Americas,” reads the Doctrine of Discovery website, administered by the Indigenous Values Initiative.
> 
> “These Papal Bulls were a continuation of what had been going on since at least the 8th century from Charlemagne, through the Crusades, the Inquisition, the war on witches, to the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula,” the site says. 
> 
> The podcast was produced at the “Religious Origins of White Supremacy” conference in December 2023 at Syracuse University in New York. The conference was organized by Professor Philip P. Arnold of Syracuse, Sandy Bigtree (Mohawk Nation,) and Adam DJ Brett.
