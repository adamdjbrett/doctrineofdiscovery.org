Excerpts:

> “What is Indian title?  It is a **mere occupancy** for the purpose of hunting.  It is not like our tenures, they have no idea of a title to the soil itself.  It is overrun by them, rather than inhabited.  **It is not a true and legal possession**.  It is a right **not to be transferred, but extinguished**. The Europeans found the territory in possession of a rude and **uncivilized** people, consisting of separate and **independent nations**.  They had no idea of property in the soil, but a right of occupation.  A right not individual but national.  This is the right gained by conquest.  The Europeans always claimed and exercised the right of conquest over the land.”
