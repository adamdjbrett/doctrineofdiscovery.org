excerpt: "We have used the term “laches” here, as did the district court and this Court in Cayuga, as a convenient shorthand for the equitable principles at stake in this case, but the term is somewhat imprecise for the purpose of describing those principles."

Excerpt:

>   “We have used the term laches here, as a **convenient shorthand** for the equitable principles at stake in this case, but the term is somewhat imprecise for the purpose of deciding those principles... The Oneidas assert that the invocation of a purported laches defense is improper here because the defendants have not established the necessary elements of such a defense.  This omission is not ultimately important, as **the equitable defense recognized in** [**_Sherrill_**](/sherrill-v-oneida-opinion-of-the-court/) **and applied in** [**_Cayuga_**](/cayuga-v-pataki/) **does not focus on the elements of traditional laches.”**
