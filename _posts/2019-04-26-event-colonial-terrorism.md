### The Doctrine of Discovery and Colonial Terrorism: A Dialogue Between Sovereign Women, Weaving Indigenous Truths Across Time and Space.

*   Tuesday 30 April, 2019.
*   6:30PM
*   ORA Gallery
*   51, 7th Avenue, New York, New York.
*   [↗︎ Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/619863358419141/)

Like the rings of a tree, the record of our people, our indigenous truth, is carried in the bones of indigenous women, which we bear forth with every birth onto our lands. Our bodies bear the testament of colonial invasion by empires both state and corporate and the stories continue through the bloodlines of indigenous survivors. While settler colonial governments present terrorist atrocities as aberrations, carried out by others - we carry the truth that terrorists atrocities began with the arrival of colonialism and continue everyday in the violent systems upheld by settler colonial governments. In this dialogue between Sovereign Women held amongst Māori and Pacific artworks on the Doctrine of Discovery, Indigenous truths will be woven from the past to the present with a vision to the future and across continents between Māori and Haudenosaunee Nations.
