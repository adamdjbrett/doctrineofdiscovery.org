- Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, Göttingen
- Diversity Studies Centre Oslo (DISCO), Oslo Metropolitan University
- Indigenous Values Initiative, Syracuse University Henry Luce Project, American Indian Law Alliance

## Details
These two workshops examine *othering, *which is the conceptualization of certain categories of fellow humans as irreconcilably different, most often in depreciative and derogatory ways. Othering provides the basis of social attitudes, interactions, linguistic forms, political strategies, and legal rulings throughout history that have served to colonize, disempower, dominate, or destroy groups of people categorized on the basis of various principles of differentiation, including skin color, language, and religion. The workshops will engage the voices of Indigenous Peoples to focus on the specifically Christian bases of othering, i.e. those positing Christianity as a superior norm and non-Christian religious traditions and experiences as inferior. Christian othering has two analytical modes to be addressed in the seminars:

Firstly, we address the origins and causes of othering in the history of Christianity from an Indigenous orientation: When why and in what senses are non-Christian peoples throughout the world perceived as "the other"? Christian othering has been especially evident in the treatment of Indigenous Peoples, whose perspective clarifies the detrimental impacts of "othering" presently. The roots of colonization can be found in the Doctrine of Christian Disco-very (DoCD), initiated with a series of 15th century PapalBulls that justified enslavement, land theft, and resource extraction initially by explorers of Portugal and Spain who were raiding Africa and the American continent. TheDoCD justified the superiority of the European Christian states and thereby reinforced the law in many postcolonial national states for expropriating territory and violating rights of Indigenous Peoples. Religious codes of domination, based in "Christendom," have permeated multiple dimensions of society and government. Discovery was motivated by the marginalization and destruction of Jews was a defining feature of several Christian polities from the Middle Ages through the early modern period. While anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim racism can be seen to be secularized in our time, these prejudices and practices still bear the imprint of Christian othering.

Secondly, we will examine our own academic traditions in order to investigate othering in scholarship and in university teaching as this is produced by hegemonic Christian and Eurocentric approaches and perspectives. As an alternative, the comparative history of religions (Eliade, Long, Carrasco) engages traditions outside of the Western academy as an equally viable point of departure. The proper study of the history of religions in, for instance, the Americas, the Islamic world, and India, provides examples of great intellectual traditions beyond Europe and the Anglo-American US. Much has been said about the Western biases in the academic study of religion but the starting point for these workshops is the belief that research in comparative history of religions can potentially offer methods and perspectives for knowing and valuing other cultures that need to be heeded in these urgent times.

The two workshops will represent important steps in developing the themes and structure of a larger, culminating event, the Religious Origins-Conference 8-10 Dec. 2023 at Syracuse University.
