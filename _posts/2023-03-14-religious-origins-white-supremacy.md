## The conference will take place at Syracuse University from 8-10 December 2023.

## Sponsored by:

-   Henry Luce Foundation
-   Syracuse University

## Description

In the 1823 US Supreme Court decision, [*Johnson v M'Intosh*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/21us543), Chief Justice John Marshall wrote,"...discovery gave title to government...[and] the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives." This decision underpins US property law. Marshall's deliberate use of the word "discovery" is an intentional reference to 15<sup>th</sup> Century Catholic Papal Bulls, which stated that any Christian who "discovers" a land populated by non-Christians has superior title, or rights of ownership, over that land. In essence, *Johnson* codifies into US law the principle of Euro-Christian domination over Indigenous Peoples. In the most devastating sense, the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DoCD) legitimized exploitation, extraction, and enslavement globally and enshrined these practices as the basis of U.S. property law still cited today as recently as 2005 (in [*Sherrill v. Oneida*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-855)) and 2020 ([*McGirt v. Oklahoma*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-9526)).

In the 200<sup>th</sup> year of *Johnson*, there is an urgent need for global recognition of the decision's implications as reifying the DoCD and its exploitation of Indigenous Peoples and their connection to land, regarded as a living being (Mother Earth in English.) This conference builds on the history of collaboration at Syracuse University with Indigenous communities across Central New York by expanding dissemination of the pernicious ideologies of DOCD and *Johnson*, leading to further repudiation of these ideologies and towards healing and repair.

The project's key collaborators include [Syracuse University](https://syracuse.edu), [American Indian Law Alliance (AILA)](https://aila.ngo), [Indigenous Values Initiative (IVI)](https://indigenousvalues.org/), The [Skä-noñh -- Great Law of Peace Center](https://www.skanonhcenter.org/), and others.
