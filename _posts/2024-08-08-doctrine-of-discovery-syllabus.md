Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to our podcast, blog, and conference. As part of the Doctrine of Discovery Project we wanted to do a syllabus showcasing all of the amazing open-access work that is being done on the Doctrine of Christian Discovery. This is a proposed or imagined course to be taught as a combined undergraduate and graduate course hopefully sometime soon at Syracuse University. May this syllabus encourage, support, and give you ideas for your own course.
