## About the Film
2025 is the 10th anniversary since the premier of this award-winning and compelling film "The Doctrine of Discovery: Unmasking The Domination Code" (by Steven T. Newcomb, and directed and co-produced by Sheldon Wolfchild) This presentation helps to connect the dots to root causes behind current events & crises affecting All Peoples & our beloved Earth and this little known history. The film tells the story of how ancient Vatican documents of the fifteenth century resulted in a tragic global momentum of domination and dehumanization. This led to law systems in the U.S. and Canada, and throughout the world, that are still used against Original Indigenous Nations & Peoples to this day. These destructive patterns set into motion systems that affect All Peoples, Beings & our Precious Planet. The mindset of domination expands resulted in the current ecological, social, economic & political issues affecting us all.

*We respect people of all faiths & backgrounds. Parts of the film can be sensitive for some viewers. It examines the legacy of domination code systems & patterns. The film concludes with traditional teachings developed over thousands of years that provide a positive alternative.

## Background:

In 1992, Mr. Newcomb, along with his friend and mentor Birgil Kills Straight, (Oglala, Lakota Headman) called upon the Vatican to revoke the Papal Bulls of Domination and dehumanization (Doctrine of Discovery) of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their work has become a global movement for change and healing. Mr. Newcomb's best-selling book, Pagans in the Promised Land; Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery shares his decades of research. Mr. Newcomb's book, film and research is celebrated by universities, communities, churches, advocates, and Peoples of all backgrounds throughout the world. In 2015, Mr. Newcomb released the award-winning film, titled, The Doctrine of Discovery: Unmasking the Domination Code. In 2016, Mr. Newcomb, with a group of Original Nations elders, and friends spoke with Pope Francis at the Vatican. Ongoing efforts and conversations continue.
