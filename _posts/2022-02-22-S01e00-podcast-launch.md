> We begin this episode with a [land acknowledgement](/land/). Our hosts Prof. [Philip P. Arnold and Sandy Bigtree (Mohawk Nation)](https://indigenousvalues.org/about/our-team/) begin by explaining the need for and importance of this podcast and how they hope it will be a helpful educational resource for college classrooms.

> To begin mapping [The Doctrine of Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/) our hosts start by discussing the iconic, Christopher Columbus. A man who literally embodies the Doctrine of Discovery. His voyage was funded by the Roman Catholic Church and the Crowns of Europe. A series of [papal bulls](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/papal-bulls/) provided the theological and legal justifications for the European settler-colonizers to feel comfortable participating in Enslavement, Exploitation, and Extraction (Steven T. Newcomb’s _Pagans in the Promised Land_ helps to explain this helpful summary of the Papal Bulls).
