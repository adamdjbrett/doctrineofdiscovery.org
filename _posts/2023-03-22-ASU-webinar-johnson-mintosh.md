Johnson v M’Intosh is an 1823 U.S. Supreme Court case about how the Discovery Doctrine was used to justify denying Native Americans and Indigenous Peoples’ legal rights to their ancestral lands. We have a great line-up of international scholars who will discuss its impact to Indigenous Peoples historically and focus on their modern-day resistance to this legal principle.

This webinar was free and open to public
