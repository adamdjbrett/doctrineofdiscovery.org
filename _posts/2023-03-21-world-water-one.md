> Ten years since the **First Dismantling the Doctrine of Discovery International Conference **held at Arizona State University West on April 19-20, 2013, the **[Continental Commission Abya Yala](https://www.boulderfriendsmeeting.org/wp-content/friends9x4Q/2013/06/Indigenous-Proclamation-Philadelphia-Sept-24-2015.pdf)** will advance into the next cycle of INTENT and ENGAGEMENT towards the objectives and goals of the local-regional, continental-global initiative which has remained active across the continent throughout this most recent chapter of our collective history as **Original Nations** of **Indigenous Peoples** of **Abya Yala**.
> 
> The continental call to consciousness and courage will be emitted today at dawn during the **Tlanexpapalotl** (Butterfly Sun) Ceremonies of the [**Izcalli Abya Yala**](https://redabyayala.blogspot.com/2021/01/izcalli-abya-yala-2021-tlanexpapalotl.html?fbclid=IwAR2umQnlYGgFO4ojkLjHekfso-9q_cGjqkwfMKVco3rU5RWvGk0fudMS6LE) at dawn. The date corresponds to the spring equinox north of the equator, and the fall equinox in the south which will occur on March 20, 2023.
> 
> As was the case ten years ago, the call by the Continental Commission Abya Yala is being led by the same three organizations of Indigenous Peoples: Techantit, Vision Maya, and TONATIERRA.
> 
> Now advancing beyond the initial ten-year phase of the Dismantling of the Doctrine of Discovery of Christendom, the Continental Commission will coordinate and synchronize with ceremonial protocols appropriate to each particular nation and territory, the **EMERGENCE** and **REGENERATION** of the **Original Nations** of **Indigenous Peoples** of **Abya Yala** in exercise of an autonomous and interdependent geopolitical continental alliance of Indigenous Self Determination.
> 
> In the north, the ceremonies will commence at sunrise and go to noon of the Tlanexpapalotl (Spring Equinox) on March 20, 2023.
> 
> South of the equator, the Original Nations of Indigenous Peoples of Abya Yala will synchronize and coordinate accordingly as they celebrate the Yohualpapalotl (Fall Equinox) in complementarity with the spirit of the **Kundur Anka**, the **Continental Confederation** of the **Eagle-Condor**.
